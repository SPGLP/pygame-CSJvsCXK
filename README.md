## Project Description
This game is a lightweight stand-alone game on PC developed using PYTHON language and based on PYGAME technology, and is available for Windows platform.
<br />

This game is a simple throwing game in which the protagonist (CSJ) moves through the keyboard and throws chicken soup to attack the enemy (CXK). Ability to record the number of throws a player, the number of hits and calculate the hit rate in real time.
<br />

This game was written casually by me, as a PYTHON beginner, this project is also my first project to use the more complete Git flow for version management and official release, and also as a practice of Git and version control technology. At the same time, I pay tribute to the two Bilibili meme stars who brought us happy meme time.
<br />

## How it works
```→``` or ```D```: Move to the right
<br />

```←``` or ```A```: Move to the left
<br />

```↓``` or ```S``` or ```SPACE```: Throw chicken soup
<br />

```P```: The game pauses and the detailed panel is displayed
<br />
